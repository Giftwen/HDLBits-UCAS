# HDLBits-UCAS

#### 介绍
HDLBits is a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). Earlier problems follow a tutorial style, while later problems will increasingly challenge your circuit design skills.

Each problem requires you to design a small circuit in Verilog. HDLBits gives you immediate feedback on the circuit module you submit. Your circuit is checked for correctness by simulating with a set of test vectors and comparing it to our reference solution.
